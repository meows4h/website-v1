# My Personal Website -- 'website-v1'
Calling this version 1 is a lie. I've attempted to make websites before, such as when I took CS290 for Web Development, even as far back as when I was taking a web development course for graphic design, but those sites were really tuned down and rudimentary.

## Notes
- This site uses W3 CSS, as well as a provided template to get started on code
- I created all the JavaScript unrelated to the navigation and page responsiveness to device size
- This uses Handlebars to render the HTML pages, with the formatting and page layouts created by me
